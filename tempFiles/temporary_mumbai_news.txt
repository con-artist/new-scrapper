Drives against illegal colonies and unauthorised construction across the district will continue. We will also increase interaction with RWAs and encourage them to come forward and share information about various kinds of violations with the department to improve enforcement, he told TOI. I will also work on resolving issues between RWAs and developers in licensed colonies. This is, in fact, Madholias third stint in Gurugram . He served as an assistant town planner from 2011 to 2015 and again from 2017 to 2018. A graduate of the School of Planning and Architecture, Madholia was previously handing the issues of licenced colonies in sectors 58 to 80 as DTP at headquarters. He also worked as DTP in Yamunanagar, Karnal and Chandigarh districts. His predecessor, RS Batth, who has been transferred as DTP Karnal, conducted more than 200 demolition and sealing drives against illegal colonies in Gurugram in the past couple of years and cleared around 1,000 acres of land. Mushrooming and redevelopment of illegal colonies need to be stopped. Offenders often start developing illegal colonies after a demolition drive. Therefore, regular vigil has to be ensured by various agencies, the new DTP said. On the rising number of complaints against the property owners violating construction norms after being issued occupation certificates, he said that strict orders have been issued by top officials directing the district town planners to randomly check a few properties. In case the property owners have not adhered to the plan and made violations later, strict action would be taken against them, he said.

The dedicated childrens hospital under Delhi government is getting a new block, which was initially planned to be developed as a dedicated Covid hospital after the second wave last year. However, since there was no surge in infection, the new building was allotted for the hospitals expansion. Dr Urmila Jhamb, its director, said, We will increase the facilities over time. The expansion of departments and beds are in the pipeline. The initial focus is on a huge pediatric ICU and cardiothoracic surgery, which are the need of the hour. Most children with congenital issues find it difficult to get admission in other government hospitals. The super-specialty hospital located in Geeta Colony provides comprehensive medical care for all pediatric-related medical and surgical illnesses under one roof. Spread across 1.6 hectares, it is also being developed as a postgraduate teaching and training institute. Trauma care services and neuro surgery have also been planned. The new building with 600 beds will allow for huge expansion. Out of these, 50-60 beds will be reserved for ICU and another 50-60 for NICU. We are also upgrading radiology services and ventilators. We have procured ECO and digital X-ray machines and are working towards purchasing a CT-MRI machine. Our current bed strength is 250. We are increasing the academic seats from four pediatric MD seats to 10, apart from two MCH surgery seats, said Jhamb. The hospital sees 1,600-1,700 children daily in the OPD, 200-300 in emergency and 40-50 admissions. Currently, the hospital provides special services in pediatric, gastroenterology, neurotology, nephrology with pediatric dialysis and neurology. Psychologists are also present to take care of children and provide certificates to specially abled ones. Our OPDs mostly see cases of diarrhea, upper respiratory problems, skin issues and fever. Admissions are usually done for heart-related problems and congenital abnormalities. We have pediatric ophthalmology, a dedicated ENT, orthopedics and a reasonably large department of pediatric surgeries. Neonatal surgeries are not carried out elsewhere, so we see a good number of patients at our facility, Jhamb said. Construction is likely to get over in the next few months and the block is expected to start by the year-end. The only hindrance is shortage of medical staff. The facility currently has a vacancy of around 17 posts of faculty members, apart from junior and senior residents.", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhis-govt-children-hospital-to-expand/articleshow/92528999.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T04:52:00+05:30"}

Police received a call about the missing daughter of a labourer, and later found her body in a drain. Brijendra Kumar Yadav, DCP (Outer-North), said the girl went to sleep with her mother and sister in their shanty in Bawana on Sunday night. When her mother woke up at around 2am, she couldn't find the child. The panicked mother alerted other people and family members and their friends searched for the baby, but in vain, Yadav said. On Monday morning, around 5.30am, the family was informed by a woman rag-picker that the body of the child was lying in the drain. The family rushed to the spot, 150-200 meters away from their shack, and found their daughter dead. After the statutory formalities, the girls body was taken to the mortuary. During the inquiry, we scanned CCTV footage of the area and found that a person had sneaked into the shack and kidnapped the girl, police said on Tuesday. With the help of digital evidence, the identity of the accused was established and he was arrested. A team led by Rakesh Yadav, station house officer of Bawana police station led the investigation and questioned more than 50 people. A clue hinted at his presence in Bawana and the suspect, Sunil, a native of Etah in Uttar Pradesh, was finally nabbed. During interrogation, Sunil told us that he wanted to raise a baby and kidnapped the girl, said DCP Yadav. But Sunil had second thoughts about what he had done and fearing he might be caught, he threw the baby in the drain. His testimony is being scrutinised. We suspect that before committing the crime, he had conducted a recce of the area and the girls house. A police officer said the presence of mud and water in the cavities of the deceased baby suggested that she might have drowned to death. We are waiting for the post-mortem report, the officer said. Sunil is a semi-skilled labourer and works in a hosiery factory. He is unmarried and lives alone in a locality in Bawana.

IMD expects rain activity to begin from Wednesday and provide a respite from Thursday, even issuing an orange alert predicting light to moderate rain with gusty winds on Thursday. With the monsoon missing its normal onset date of June 27, the capital has been crying for rain. Delhi has received just 15.8mm of rainfall in June so far as against the normal of 56.1mm, a rain deficit of 72%. The monsoon is likely to hit Delhi between June 30 and July 1. It depends on rainfall distribution and rain intensity, said R K Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD. The met department hadnt forecast a date for monsoon onset in Delhi earlier to this. However, the arrival of the rain-bearing monsoon may still be delayed this year. Three to five days from the normal onset date is not considered a delayed monsoon. However, we can comment on this only after the monsoon hits Delhi, said Jenamani. According to IMD, the monsoon arrived in Delhi on July 13 in 2021 and on June 25 a year earlier. Though the met department has predicted rain activity from Wednesday, the day temperature showed no sign of abating on Tuesday. The maximum temperature recorded at Safdarjung, which is the citys base station, was 41.5 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal. Before this, the citys highest maximum temperature for the month was on June 15 with 39.6 degrees Celsius. The heat index (feel-like temperature when relative humidity is combined with temperature) was 53 degrees Celsius. The relative humidity oscillated between 74% and 45%. Due to easterly winds, the weather has become humid for the past three days, explained Jenamani. However, as the clouds have arrived, rain can be expected in the city from Wednesday. Jenamani added, On Tuesday, the maximum temperature recorded in most stations departed by four to six degrees from the normal.

As power demand in Delhi continues its northward climb, it is projected to go beyond the 8,000 MW-mark. Prior to June 9, Delhis peak power demand hadnt ever crossed 7,000 MW in the month of June. This year, the mark has already been breached nine times in June and once in May. In 2019 and 2020, the record demand was 6,314MW and 6,769 MW, respectively, both on the same date, June 29. In 2021, the peak was 6,921 MW on June 30 in 2021. The capital recorded a peak power demand of 7,166 MW on June 9, followed by 7,129 MW the following day.

While the maximum temperature at Safdarjung was recorded at 41.5 degrees C, a shade higher than the previous day's maximum of 40.9 degrees, the real feel temperature was hazardously high at around 55C. The real feel is a measure of the weather's impact on people, taking into account both temperature and humidity. While monsoon is likely to enter parts of UP and the hill states by Wednesday, it may hit Delhi-NCR on June 30 or July 1, IMD said. The wet bulb temperature (WBT) is another indicator of the impact of the weather conditions that is increasingly being used as climate change begins to hit more regions across the world. Defined as the lowest temperature at which water starts to evaporate, it can be measured by wrapping a wet cloth around a thermometer. Like real feel, WBTs also denote the combined effect of temperature and humidity on people. The WBT, as measured at Safdarjung at 2.30pm, was 30 degrees C on both Monday and Tuesday, the highest values reached so far this year. By contrast, when the highest temperature of the month was recorded on June 8, the WBT was a low 23.4 degrees C. Thats because relative humidity on June 8 (2.30pm) was 14%, which had risen more than three-fold to 45% by June 28, said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. The Met department plans to incorporate parameters such as WBT while developing a heat index for different regions of the country, which would better capture the impact of weather conditions on the population. The index could be operational by next year, sources said. Jenamani said the effect of rain in Delhi-NCR is likely to be felt by June 30 or July 1, when the maximum temperature is expected to drop to 33-35 degrees.

In January 2014, Paliwal asked the complainant, Shakuntala, to invest Rs 20 crore in his mine and assured to pay her Rs 50 lakh each month. An MoU was signed between them in February 2014. On March 3, 2014, Paliwal executed a sale deed for 1.4 hectares land in Bhilwara district in Shakuntalas favour for Rs 21 lakh. In 2017, the accused again promised good quality granite to Shakuntala and signed an MoU for Rs 20 crore.

Sources said samples collected at AIIMS, Lok Nayak Hospital and ILBS had this strain. In Haryana, the BA.2 variant remains the dominant one at present, being detected in 75% of the samples sequenced. While the Delhi government health department did not comment on the finding of the new sub-lineage, officials associated with genome sequencing stated that Central, South East and South districts had shown the presence of BA.5. South East district magistrate Isha Khosla said, Two days ago, we got instructions to intensify vaccination and follow Covid protocols strictly, so we are focusing on that. Testing, tracking and isolation is being done by the rules. So far, there are no reports of clusters emerging for B.A.5, but we are keeping track of it. We had three patients carrying the B.A.5 sub-lineage, but they have been discharged. When they were admitted, they didnt show any severity and had mild symptoms. said Lok Nayak medical director Dr Suresh Kumar. Genome sequencing is not being done on samples from any specific district or hospitals. We found two samples carrying the B.A.5 sub-lineage of Omicron, said an ILBS official. Haryana health department officials told TOI that 580 samples were sent to Rohtaks Maharshi Dayanand University for genome sequencing in May and June. Of these, 260 had been processed with 195 having the BA.2 sub-type of Omicron, 54 with BA 2.23 and BA 2.38 and BA.5 and 10 probable Omicron or XT. One was found to have the B.1.1.529 sub-variant. Gurugrams chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav said the dominance of the Omicron sub-lineages explained the current spike in cases in the region. Omicron has a higher transmissible level. Its derivatives spread rapidly in absence of hand hygiene, social distancing and masks. Dr Lalit Kant, former scientist and head, epidemiology and communicable diseases division, ICMR, said, If genome sequencing is increased, more samples will be found carrying B.A.5, which is 13-15% more infectious. Vaccine immunisation is waning and people are becoming susceptible to the virus. Dr Jugal Kishore, head, medicine department at Safdarjung Hospital, said though extra measures were not required, surveillance should continue. From June 7 to 28, Delhi recorded 47 deaths, with two days registering six deaths. Preventive measures have to be adopted and precautionary doses should be increased to protect severe cases. However, there wont be any major surge owing to the new sub-variants. Those with a compromised immune system and comorbidities may be at risk, added Kishore.", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-traces-ba-5-sub-variant-even-as-daily-covid-cases-decline/articleshow/92529395.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T04:39:00+05:30"}

Chief metropolitan magistrate Snigdha Sarvaria added that Zubairs mobile phone or laptop used by him for posting the tweet was to be recovered from his Bengaluru residence. Zubair told the court the tweet was posted in 2018 and he had used an image from a Hindi film. He said he was being targeted because he challenges powerful people. From 2018 to 2022, tweets have not created a flutter Describing the case based on an image from a Hindi movie against Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair as bordering on \"absurdity\", his counsel Vrinda Grover told a Delhi court on Tuesday that the police had called Zubair for questioning in some other case but arrested him in the present case in haste. Grover told the court that many others had tweeted the same, and the only difference between those Twitter handles and his was his faith, his name and his profession. The police had on June 27 arrested Zubair for allegedly hurting religious sentiments following a complaint by a social media user who referred to a tweet from 2018. The complainant in the case goes by the Twitter name, Hanuman Bhakt, with an image of Lord Hanuman as his profile photo. From 2018 to 2022, these tweets have not created a flutter. Not a single ingredient of the offences invoked in this case is satisfied. Which are the two groups between whom enmity is created? Who does it incite? What is the insult? Many tweeted the said tweet and still there was no flutter. Prima facie there is no case. Honeymooners and brahmacharis are not the two groups creating unrest in the country, the senior counsel told the court. Explaining her observation, she said the image in Zubairs tweet was from a 1983 film of Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Kissi Se Na Kehna, and in the scene from which the image was used in the tweet, the actress had remarked on seeing a board outside a hotel that it was not honeymoon hotel, but Hanuman hotel. The prosecution had sought extension of Zubairs custody by five days on the ground that he did not cooperate with the investigating agency and his custodial interrogation was required to gather information regarding the device from which the tweet was made by the accused. Zubair was produced before the court on the expiry of his one-day police custody. Considering that the mobile phone/laptop of the accused for posting the tweet in question is to be recovered at the instance of accused Mohammed Zubair from his Bangalore residence, that the accused has remained non-cooperative and (with) the disclosure statement on record, four days PC (police custody) remand of accused is granted since accused is to be taken to Bangalore, the judge said in the order. Responding to the argument of Grover that the film from which the image was used had not been banned and that the image had not been edited, the court said it was of no help to the accused at this stage. During the hearing, Grover said Zubair was a journalist, has a Twitter following and speaks his mind in an independent country. Zubair is being targeted for his work. He may be challenging people who are powerful but that cant be a reason for his harassment, she claimed. She said the police were asking for his laptop which has nothing to do with the case. The police are abusing their power. Zubairs laptop is a storehouse of his personal information. They want his laptop because he is a journalist. Their laptops contain sensitive information. A fishing inquiry begins when the laptop is seized. That tweet cannot withstand legal scrutiny. He has been challenging people who are speaking certain things. Will that deprive him of his liberty? she asked. Pointing out that the anonymous Twitter handle which called out Zubairs tweet was opened only in 2021, she told the judge that this anonymous social media account needed to be investigated. The entire case borders on absurdityThe penalty under 153A is a maximum of three years. The penalty under 295 is up to two years. This is a tweet from 2018. Their own cause of action is March 2018. If an anonymous Twitter handle chose to create mischief in the country, those reasons should be investigated, Grover submitted. The public prosecutor, appearing for the police, claimed that it has become a trend to outrage the religious feelings of the Hindu community to become famous. He alleged that the accused had made several such outrageous posts in the past to hurt religious sentiments. This was a deliberate effort on his (Zubairs) part to create social disharmony and hurt religious feelings. He joined the probe but did not cooperate and various material from his phone were deletedThere is a requirement of police remand. This is the first time it came to the polices knowledge, the prosecutor argued. He threatened the investigating officer. His parents have his laptop from which data will be deleted. He came with a blank phone, said the prosecutor. He added that the complainant was not anonymous and his details were known.", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/alt-news-co-founder-mohammed-zubair-in-police-custody-till-july-2/articleshow/92529383.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T04:36:00+05:30"}

The officer also pointed out, Alongside, more cases have been solved and more accused arrested compared with the figures in 2021. Times View The rising number of crimes against women in the city is a matter of concern. The police must look into the reasons and find ways to curb them. Delhi Police claimed to have taken up various initiatives aimed at womens security, including the women-staffed pink booths to assist women in need and to guide them in accessing legal remedies. All-women patrolling teams were also launched in crowded areas and outside schools and colleges to deter criminals from trying to trouble them.

However, they went for his arrest after he remained evasive and his phone was found formatted. The search memo signed by Zubair at the time of arrest showed the recovery of the notice, sources said. Police clarified that the FIR against Zubair was registered suo motu during a social media monitoring exercise. DCP (Cyber Cell) KPS Malhotra said Zubairs objectionable tweet had led to a Twitter storm with hate speeches detrimental to communal harmony. Two things, technical gadget and intention, were important. He was evasive on both and the phone had been formatted. This formed the grounds for his arrest, he added. Regarding the claim that police acted in a matter of 2018, Malhotra said time didnt matter in the investigation of a case. He added, You only have to re-tweet and it becomes new. Police action was on the basis of when the matter came to our cognisance. On the allegations of the case being politically motivated, Malhotra said if someone was booked in several cases, it was well within polices rights to question him in all. The judiciary is involved, custody was given and bail not granted. There must be some substance to the case. Calling it politically motivated doesnt stand right. The case will be investigated on merit, he added. On Monday, Zubair was arrested on the charges of promoting enmity on religious grounds and deliberately hurting religious feelings through a post on Twitter wherein he allegedly posted a questionable image with a purpose to deliberately insult the god of a particular religion. Zubair was booked under IPC sections 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc, and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony).", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/alt-news-co-founder-mohammad-zubair-case-delhi-cops-may-write-to-ed-i-t/articleshow/92529378.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T04:32:00+05:30"}

During interrogation, Kumar revealed that he had killed his wife on June 14 with the help of his brother as he was fed up with her habits, the officer said.

During questioning, he has been evasive on both fronts. We found out that his phone was formatted. His evasiveness formed the grounds for his arrest,\" KPS Malhotra, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Intelligence Fusion & Strategic Operations) said. The police officer said a four-member police team will be sent to Zubair's house in Bengaluru on Wednesday to recover evidence, including the mobile phone or laptop used by him for posting the tweet in question. The mobile phone that he is currently using is formatted and does not have information related to the case that is being investigated. However, the phone will be sent to forensic lab for examination, the officer said. During investigation, when asked about his phone through which he posted the alleged tweet in 2018, he told police that he had lost it. \"He joined the probe but did not cooperate and various material from his phone was deleted,\" he added.

The court, however, rejected the submission saying it was of no assistance to the accused at this stage. Officials in the Delhi Police told PTI that the FIR was registered on June 20 against Zubair. According to an emergency police officer on duty, \"during social media monitoring, it came to notice that a Twitter handle namely Hanuman Bhakt @balajikijaiiin shared a tweet against another Twitter handle in the name of Mohammed Zubair@zoo_bear in which it has been tweeted by Zubair that 'Before 2014: Honeymoon Hotel.

Kindly take action against this guy\". \"These words and picture found to be used by Zubair against a particular religious community and are highly provocative and more than sufficient to incite feeling of hatred amongst people which can be detrimental for maintenance of public tranquility in the society,\" the FIR stated. It further stated that transmission and publication of such posts has been deliberately done by Zubair through electronic media to insult the religious feelings of a particular community with intent to provoke breach of peace and the SI also stated that the FIR is not to be uploaded being \"sensitive\" in nature. Earlier in the day, the Delhi Police told the court that Zubair allegedly \"used controversial tweets to hurt religious feelings in an effort to get fame\". Zubair was arrested by the Delhi Police on Monday for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through one of his tweets posted in 2018, officials said. Police claimed that Zubair posted such tweets to increase his followers, but did not substantiate the claim. His arrest drew condemnations from various quarters, including journalists' bodies and Opposition parties. On Tuesday, Alt News co-founder Pratik Sinha rejected a media report that Zubair had received Rs 50 lakh in his account in the last three months. Sinha shared the news article on Twitter and said, \"Fact-check: Absolutely lies. Police is linking donations received by Alt News to Zubair. All the money that Alt News receives goes to the organisations bank and not any individuals. The bank statement of Zubair's personal account of which I have a copy debunks this falsehood.\" However, DCP Malhotra said that they are also looking at the source of funding received by Zubair and as per the investigation so far, they do have evidence that in the last three months, Zubair had received Rs 50 lakh in his bank account. When asked if Sinha has anything to do with the case, the officer said so far, his involvement has not been found.

While talking to the press in Jaipur earlier in the day, Shekhawat says that the (Union) government is ready to help the state government in making the project functional, but Gehlot is deflecting the matter with his uncalled statements. The meeting is also attended by state party brass including state president Satish Poonia, deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore and former state president Arun Chaturvedi clearly indicates that the party is seeing it as a goose with golden eggs. They passed a resolution to create awareness among the residents of these districts on how the Gehlot government is creating obstacles in the way of the project which promises prosperity of the people, said a BJP source who has attended the meeting. The project can be a game-changer for 40% of the population in the state and is seen as crucial to the assembly polls. The recent statement of Shekhawat assuring to clear the project within two months if a revised proposal is sent has sparked a fresh round of statements. The project has become a bone of contention between the state and the Centre over granting approval from Madhya Pradesh over a share of water and declaring it a national project so that share of funds changes from 60:40 to 90:10 between the Centre and the state respectively, said a source. In April, the Congress had held a day-long protest in all the 13 districts which signalled the complete politicisation of the issue by blaming the delay on the central government. The BJP doesnt want to share the credit of ERCP with the Congress at any cost. It is unlikely that it will declare it a national project under the reign of Gehlot or the Congress government. The best it can do is to facilitate the inter-state agreement between MP and Rajasthan by taking a full credit to reap the dividends in the assembly polls, said a source. The project was launched in 2017 by former chief minister Vasundhara Raje who demanded the national status in the same year from water resource minister Nitin Gadkari. The project had even become one of the key promises of the BJP in the assembly polls in 2018. It was prominently mentioned by Modi and Raje in their election speeches in Ajmer and Jaipur. Modis calling to consider it for the national project is being repeatedly highlighted by Gehlot. The former has been accusing the latter of not cooperating in the project while the latter is accusing the Modi government of betrayal by not granting the national status.", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/bjp-aims-to-reap-rich-dividends-from-eastern-raj-canal-project/articleshow/92532860.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T08:39:22+05:30"}

However, he said, We are examining the steps taken by other states in this regard, and will implement reserving government job for local if such a situation develops in the country. If it is not illegal, the state government will implement it, he said. Independent MLA Baljeet Yadav and Rajasthan Berojgar Mahasangh have been demanding reservations to local youth in government jobs. He said, the state government had already announced 3 lakh jobs to the youth in the government sector. The present government till now has given 1.25 lakh jobs, while 1 lakh jobs are under process and an announcement has been made to give 1 lakh more jobs, he said. Haryana this year notified a law reserving 75% of jobs in the private sector for local people, subject to an income ceiling of Rs 30,000 and a minimum five years of residentship in the state.

If you give a concrete suggestion, I will try to present a youth-centric budget next year,\" he said.

In this regard, the national health mission (state) mission director, Jitendra Kumar Soni , issued directions to all district collectors to implement the campaign in their respective districts. Screening for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) will be done in a largescale manner in the state as the virus may be transmitted from infected mother to her baby while giving birth. It can also be transmitted by contact with infected blood or other body fluids during sex, unsafe injections or exposures to sharp instruments. Chronic HCV and HBV can cause damage to liver damage, cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver cancer and even death.

All five have been booked in different cases, including one filed by a BBMP official. The suspects allegedly generated fake bills that were given to taxpayers. In the first case, Banashankari police registered a cheating, forgery and criminal breach of trust case against four revenue staffers based on a complaint filed by Dinesh Kumar Jain, a businessman. Jain, who owns a property at Bhairappa Block in Tyagarajanagar, visited the BBMP office on April 22, 2018 to pay pending property taxes for 10 years  2008 to 2018. He alleged: I met revenue inspector Ramaiah H and revenue collector Srinivasa. First they said I must pay Rs 3.5 lakh as tax for 10 years, including penalty and interest. Then they assured me they could help me save Rs 1 lakh if I paid the tax in cash instead of doing so online. I believed them and gave Rs 2.5 lakh to Ramaiah. As per their instructions, data- entry operators Manju and Pradeep gave me receipts for the payment. While Jain had thought his dues had been cleared, he learnt about the scam when he tried making another tax payment  this time online. According to the complainant, his online attempt to pay tax for 2019 was rejected. On June 18, 2022, he went to the BBMP office in Yediyur and enquired about the issue. BBMP officials told him he hadnt paid tax since 2008 and hence his payment wasnt being accepted. When he produced the receipts for the Rs 2.5 lakh he had paid in 2018, the officials informed him that they were fake bills, said a police source. On June 24, Jain approached Banashankari police and filed a complaint against Ramaiah, Srinivasa, Manju and Pradeep. Police said they have summoned the suspects for investigation and will arrest them if preliminary probe proves the allegations. In the other case, a woman, Shamshad Begum, alleged that Palike staff collected more than Rs 1.4 lakh as property tax from her and gave fake receipts. Based on Begums allegation, BBMP revenue inspector Anand KS filed a police complaint. KR Puram police have registered a cheating, forgery and criminal breach of trust case against the suspect, identified as Sathish. Anand told police a person identifying himself as Sathish, a data-entry operator, visited Begums house two years ago and informed her about non-payment of property tax and collected more than Rs 1.4 lakh from her. Begum learned about the fraud on June 22, when she visited the BBMP office in Bhattarahalli to pay property tax. The BBMP staff informed her she hadnt paid tax since 2018. Begum produced a receipt of Rs 73,995 for 2018-19 and another receipt of Rs 68,141 for 2019-20. However, as in the case of Jain, the BBMP staff said the receipts were fake. The tax payment history for Begums property showed the last payment was made on October 15, 2019 (Rs 19,715). In his plaint, Anand stated there was no staffer named Sathish.", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/4-bbmp-staff-among-5-booked-in-4-lakh-property-tax-fraud/articleshow/92529852.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T03:16:09+05:30"}

Opposition parties Congress and JD(S) are bound to make it a major issue for the polls as the controversy has riled all major communities  Vokkaligas, Lingayats, and Dalits. The ruling BJP is likely to hit back over mistakes in previous revisions, especially those done when the Siddaramaiah government was in power between 2013 and 2018. Some BJP party functionaries admit that the controversy over chapters pertaining to BR Ambedkar and Kuvempu is likely to hurt them the most, considering Dalits and Vokkaligas are major vote banks in the state. The alleged disrespect to Kuvempu has given JD(S) and Congress an opportunity to undo gains BJP has made in the Vokkaliga belt of the Old Mysuru region over the last few years. The controversy has dented the partys image in the region, said B Harsha Vardhan, Nanjangud BJP MLA. We paid heavily for it in the MLC elections to South Graduates constituency which we lost. We need a course correction now.  Some say the government must rebuild its image by staying away from controversial issues and concentrating on chief minister Basavaraj Bommais budgetary promises. And more importantly, the government and party need to project the strong leadership of prime minister Narendra Modi, said Vardhan, a first-time MLA and son-in-law of Chamarajanagar MP V Srinivas Prasad. This is easier said than done. HD Kumaraswamy, former chief minister and JD(S) floor leader, confirmed this when he said neither the ruling party nor the principal opposition want the issue to die down. I can assure you that this issue will definitely resonate in the 2023 elections because the government took the revision errors very lightly, he said. Now, with the issue having received political traction, neither BJP nor Congress will let it die down.  Reinforcing Kumaraswa- mys intuitions, Congress spokesperson M Lakshman said: Both KPCC president DK Shivakumar and opposition leader Siddaramaiah have said they will continue to protest the revisions until the new textbooks are completely withdrawn. We are awaiting further directions in this regard.  On the other hand, BJP state general secretary N Ravikumar said if the opposition lets the row fester, then the saffron party will react strongly. We are hoping the issue will fizzle out with Mondays government order, he said. But if opposition parties try to keep it alive, then BJP will react strongly. Let them tell us how Tipu Sultan came to be glorified in previous textbooks while contributions by the Mysuru Wadiyars were sidelined.  Education department sources say minister BC Nagesh has commissioned a team to identify errors introduced by the previous Baraguru Ramachandrappa revision committee. They have identified as many as 169 mistakes till date. This is only in history and social science textbooks, an official said. If we start looking at other subjects, then the number will increase manifold.

Most Covid cases asymptomatic; there's no reason to panic: BBMP Amid a steady increase in Covid-19 cases, BBMP special commissioner (health) Dr KV Trilok Chandra on Tuesday said that although there was a slight increase in hospitalisation in the city, most cases were asymptomatic and hospital occupancy was restricted to the general wards. He reiterated that of the 40 samples sent for genomic sequencing, they found BA.4 and BA.5 variants to be dominant. Last week, \"However, they are not translating into serious symptoms,\" he said, adding: \"We are running 17,000 tests every day and 600 to 700 cases are being reported on average among them. Most of them are asymptomatic. There are also 40 active Covid-19 patients admitted in general wards of private hospitals, but mainly as a precautionary measure.\" Chandra said 10 more patients admitted in other wards are incidentally Covid-19 positive but are all mild cases. Asked why Mahadevpura reported the maximum caseload in the city, Dr Chandra said that this has been the trend since the first wave, mostly due to the large presence of national and international travellers in the locality. \"The department has asked IT-BT companies to follow all necessary Covid-19 protocols. We are also creating awareness on the need for booster doses for elders and vaccination among school children,\" he said. Another senior health official told TOI that most IT companies in the area push employees to undergo Covid-19 tests, even if they are asymptomatic. \"Most of the employees need an RT-PCR negative report to return to work. They take the test and then are found to be positive,\" he said. BA.5 triggering infections Experts across the globe say BA.5 variant is increasingly becoming the reason behind the rise in hospitalisation among Covid-19 patients. Dr Giridhar Babu, who heads the lifecourse epidemiology unit at Indian Institute of Public Health Bengaluru, said in this present scenario, administering vaccine booster doses will help as the immune response generated by the primary doses wanes after a few months. \"In the meantime, as evidenced by sub-lineages BA.4 and BA.5, the properties of the virus are continuously changing. Based on the evidence, these sub-lineages have higher transmissibility, higher relative growth rate and are better fit to infect. I think the increase in cases will continue into July,\" said Dr Babu. adding that the UK data also shows that in the elderly (those aged 50 and above), protection against mortality is higher only with a booster dose. \"The low coverage of booster dose is concerning and needs to be addressed on priority,\" he said. Referring to global observations and studies, Dr Babu also tweeted: \"The fitness of BA.5 is better than BA.2, making it have greater transmissibility.\" He also shared a warning with supporting data: \"BA.5 will be the predominant sub-lineage infecting most people all over the world.\" Dr Sunil Kumar DR, epidemiologist, and public health specialist, who also heads the department of community medicine at Akash Institute of Medical Sciences, agreed that both BA.5 and BA.4 have led to an increase in hospitalisations across the globe. \"The number of cases and hospitalisations in India might also increase with patients showing mild symptoms. But the impact of long Covid will affect society at large,\" said Dr Kumar, urging the government to strictly enforce masking in public places.", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-issues-fresh-covid-guidelines/articleshow/92530526.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T04:25:27+05:30"}

In Shivajinagar and Shantinagar areas, several pourakarmikas are regularly seen wearing torn clothes, with some covering the torn parts with gum tapes. Asked why they were wearing these old uniforms, the civic workers said marshals have threatened to levy fines if they dont wear uniform at work. Their employer-contractors too told them those not wearing uniforms will not be allowed to swipe at the muster centres; this could lead to them losing the days salary for not marking attendance. Lekha Adavi of BBMP Pourakarmikara Sangha said that earlier, workers did not have uniforms. After they put up a fight seeking good uniforms, gloves, masks and shoes during the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic, BBMP distributed them. The Palike has to distribute new uniforms every year. but does not seem to be bothered about their condition. We have filed several complaints with the special commissioner, Bengaluru Solid Waste Management Company (BSWMC), but nothing has been done so far, Adavi said. Uniforms were last issued to pourakarmikas in March 2020. As civic workers toil on the ground, rain or shine, these clothes do not last long. According to Adavi, pourakarmikas will go on indefinite strike from July 1 and this will be one of their demands, besides regularisation of employment. Nirmala, general secretary of the forum, said the torn clothes have robbed their labour of dignity. How can contractors force workers to wear these uniforms which are not fit to be used in the first place? The solid waste management company has to act immediately. Until new uniforms are distributed, the urban local body should not mandate that we wear uniforms in poor condition, she said. Supply started: Palike BSWMC special commissioner Harish Kumar told TOI that Karnataka Handloom Development Corporation has been tasked with distributing uniforms to pourakarmikas and has already started supplying them, spending Rs 8 crore. BBMP chief marshal Rajbir Singh dismissed as false and baseless the allegations of his men threatening pourakarmikas. He said marshals are not authorised to levy fines on pourakarmikas, but in some places they may have advised the workers to wear uniform as new ones are being issued.

It made the observation after hearing the case pertaining to a man who had paid Rs 2 lakh to book a hall in the city for his daughters wedding. The event, however, couldnt be conducted due to the night curfew in force in June 2021. The court ordered that the hall owner refund the man the advance amount and also pay a compensation of Rs 5,000 for causing him trouble. HT Ravikumar, 67, of Uttarahalli had planned his daughters wedding over two days  June 30 and July 1 last year  and booked the New Venkatadri Kalyana Mantapa on 100 Feet Ring Road in Kathriguppe, Banashankari 3rd Stage on February 22, 2021. He paid an advance amount of Rs 2 lakh towards the total fee of Rs 3.7 lakh. But the Covid situation escalated in Bengaluru, leading to the government introducing lockdowns and night curfews. With night curfew in force during the scheduled dates and also restrictions on people congregating as part of the safety guidelines, Ravikumar was forced to cancel the booking for the marriage hall. He had opted for the hall in anticipation of nearly 1,000 guests. Despite giving a cancellation letter to the manager of the kalyana mantapa as requested, Ravikumar didnt get a favourable response and was forced to run around for the refund. With no respite in sight, Ravikumar approached the Bengaluru Urban district consumer disputes redressal commission in Shantinagar with a compliant against the mantapa in September 2021. In the litigation that commenced, Ravikumars lawyer presented his case. The attorney representing New Venkatadri Kalyana Mantapa claimed that the opposite party (kalyana mantapa) had suffered losses after making arrangement for the wedding and that the customer had signed an agreement that ruled out refund in case of cancellation. The lawyer further claimed that the customer was harassing them for a refund despite the clause. In their verdict pronounced on May 26, 2022, the judges of the consumer forum asked for the document signed by the customer agreeing to no refund in case of cancellation (as they had failed to produce it in court). The judge further noted that a government order issued during the Covid crisis clearly noted that places like marriage halls, where events got cancelled due to Covid restrictions, must refund the rent paid by customers after deducting 5% as tax and in this case, Ravikumar is eligible for refund. By not granting it, the mantapa manager was at fault, they observed.

In September 2020, the state had passed a bill amending the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) Act, 1976, which empowers the agency to pass on the redevelopment rights of old dilapidated cessed buildings in the city to their tenants. It said the housing authority, Mhada, would step in if the landlords/owners fail to redevelop the buildings within a year of the notification. The main objective of this amendment was to force landlords to redevelop their dilapidated buildings. According to information received from Mhada under RTI by activist Jeetendra Ghadge, between 1970 and 2018, 815 people have lost their lives in building crashes. Urban planner and architect Chandrashekhar Prabhu said the government must formulate policies for the public residing in such buildings rather than making them builder-oriented. He added that the reasons behind the collapses of cessed buildings in the island city and tenanted buildings in suburbs were totally different. Over the years, the British-era pagdi system in Mumbai claimed lives and thousands of families lost their homes mainly because landlords did not pass on the benefits of redevelopment to their old tenants, said Ghadge. In the suburbs, tenanted buildings such as the one that collapsed in Naik Nagar on Tuesday also stand neglected. The ill-fated building in which 19 people died was allotted by the state for the tribal Vanjara community during Vasantrao Naiks tenure as chief minister. However, Vanjara community members, despite not having the powers, sold their flats to non-Vanjaras, who later discovered that they, too, did not have the powers to sell them. Hence, they rented them out while continuing to neglect repair work. As per information obtained by Ghadge from the state housing department, the Property Owners Association has written to the President urging him to reject the bill which is awaiting his assent. Further, the home ministry has sought a report on objections from the Maharashtra government. According to the association, the bill should be rejected because interim' orders have been passed in similar matters by the Supreme Court . Ghadge, who is also the founder of The Young Whistleblowers Foundation, said, An interim order was passed in May 1996 against another amendment of Mhada, which has been pending for the last 26 years in the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, hundreds of people have lost their lives due to building crashes, and the apex court is still to decide on the matter.", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bldg-crashes-have-killed-over-800-people-in-city-in-50-yrs/articleshow/92529839.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T03:15:52+05:30"}

Three of the four deceased were ONGC staff: Mukesh Kumar Patel (55), executive engineer (electrical) from Mehsana, Vijay Mandloi (32), executive engineer (mechanical) from Bhopal, and Satyambad Patra (27), a geologist from Bhubaneswar who was on his first offshore deployment. The fourth casualty was Sanju Francis from Kerala who was employed by catering and housekeeping contractor Saraf Corporation India as a room boy. ONGC said the four deceased were rescued by the Navy and brought to the base in an unconscious condition. \"Despite inclement weather conditions, the rescue operations were carried out very swiftly,\" said ONGC, adding that an inquiry has been instituted into the accident involving the leased aircraft. Chopper flying to rig turns 'topsy turvy' on water; 5 rescued survive A leased Sikorsky 76-D helicopter operated by Pawan Hans was less than two kilometres from ONGC's Sagar Kiran rig, its destination off the Mumbai coast, when the pilots made an emergency landing in poor weather. \"The pilots did not make a Mayday call,\" said a source. \"The helicopter turned topsy turvy on landing,\" he added. But it remained afloat for four-odd hours after coming down. These helicopters are fitted with automatic flotation equipment which inflates on contact with water. All the nine passengers managed to inflate their life jackets, indicating they were okay when the aircraft hit the water, said ONGC sources. Late on Tuesday evening, the survivors-two helicopter crew members and three ONGC employees-were moved to Nanavati hospital. A team from the Mumbai office of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation was present at the hospital. Four others, including three ONGC stafers, died. The Yellow Gate police have registered a case of accidental death and are probing. Built in 2014, the Sikorsky 76-D helicopter (VT-PWI) was owned by Milestone Aviation Group, a Dublin-based helicopter leasing company, said sources. It was earlier leased out to Thai Aviation Services, an offshore helicopter services provider based in Thailand. Pawan Hans leased it last year, importing it in August. \"This helicopter, first of its kind introduced into offshore operations by ONGC, had started operations only a month ago,\" said a source. The helicopter took off from Juhu helipad at 10.54 am for Sagar Kiran ONGC rig, located 60 nautical miles from Mumbai. \"At 11.45 am, ONGC informed the Pawan Hans operations room at Juhu airport that the helicopter has ditched at sea,\" said a source. Ditching is a controlled emergency landing carried out by helicopter pilots on water. Soon after, the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre said it received a distress alert, an automatic distress signal sent on impact by a transmitter on the aircraft. Indian Coast Guard (ICG) spokesperson, commandant RK Singh said: \"The International Safety Net was activated to alert nearby vessels. Within a few minutes, another ONGC aircraft was launched from Juhu airbase. ICG also diverted ICG ships and Dornier aircraft,\" said Singh. ONGC said the 'Regional Contingency Plan' was immediately activated; Indian Navy and Coast Guard were alerted. \"ONGC vessels near the location were mobilized. With prompt action, one person was rescued by lifeboat launched from ONGC rig Sagar Kiran and four persons were rescued by ONGC stand-by vessel Malviya-16,\" ONGC said in a statement. Oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri condoled the bereaved families. \"My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families for their irreparable loss. We stand with them in this hour of grief,\" he tweeted. This is the third accident linked to ONGC's operations in the Arabian Sea in recent years. A helicopter carrying five ONGC staffers had crashed off Mumbai's coast in 2018, killing all seven aboard, including the two pilots. Last year, 86 people employed on a rig died after warnings of a cyclone were disregarded and the anchor of a barge snapped during a storm. All aboard the barge had to abandon the vessel.

The agency issued a second summons for Friday to record his statement in a money laundering case. Raut, who is being probed in a money laundering case linked to properties acquired by his wife and associates, failed to turn up at the ED's office in Ballard Estate on Monday. Instead, he wrote to theED asking for an exemption from questioning until July 7. The ED declined the request and issued a second summons for Friday. The ED is investigating two separate money laundering cases against DHFL and Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) groups along with persons connected with them. Among documents seized in the two cases, the ED said it has found entries believed to connect Sanjay Raut to the companies.Raut has sought to paint the central agency's action as a politically motivated move aimed at curbing his activities amidst the crisis in the Sena. On Monday, when he received news of the summons, Raut called it \"a conspiracy to stop me.\" Replying to TOI regarding the DHFL and HDIL cases in which the ED seeks to interrogate him, the Sena trouble-shooter said, \"I have never met these people in my life. Not even talked (to them). All are political games to stop me from shielding my party.\" In the DHFL case, its erstwhile promoters-Kapil Wadhawan and his brother Dheeraj-took credit facilities from a Union Bank of India-led consortium of 17 banks and defaulted on Rs 34,615 crore in loans. The brothers allegedly siphoned off the funds from DHFL through fictitious transactions in the guise of loans to prominent builders. These builders had defaulted on repayments to DHFL. The HDIL case is related to a Rs 1,200-crore chawl redevelopment fraud, in which the ED considers the company's promoters Rakesh Wadhawan, son Sarang, and Pravin Raut, an associate of Sanjay Raut, as prime suspects. HDIL's subsidiary Guru Ashish Construction bagged the commission for redevelopment of Goregaon's Patra chawl after entering into agreement with the land owner, Mhada, a state agency, and the chawl's residents. Guru Ashish sold the FSI available on the plot to builders fraudulently without executing the project.", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-ed-turns-down-shiv-sena-mp-sanjay-rauts-plea-issues-a-second-summons/articleshow/92530619.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T04:46:14+05:30"}

According to reports, a section of independent legislators may approach Koshyari, saying they have withdrawn support to the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, following which it has lost its majority. At the time of formation of the MVA government, these independent legislators had extended support to Thackeray. If they approach the governor, Koshyari will have no option but to ask Thackeray to prove his majority. Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant said he was not aware if a petition has been filed before Kolshyari, but if he directs the CM to prove his majority, the Sena will approach the Supreme Court. During the course of hearing of the petition filed by rebel Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde, the Supreme Court had observed that the deputy speaker of the legislative assembly cannot disqualify the rebel legislators till July 12. \"Our information is that the SC has ordered status quo. Further, the court orally declined to pass any order in connection with the no- confidence motion. So it is expected that Raj Bhavan will not ask the CM to prove his majority on the floor of the house. If directions are issued for a floor test, then the Shiv Sena will approach the SC,\" Sawant said. Public works minister Ashok Chavan said since the SC has ordered status quo, he does not think Raj Bhavan will order a floor test. \"In my opinion, it is a sub-judice matter. Everyone will have to wait till July 12,\" he said. Former CM Prithviraj Chavan too felt it would be wrong to ask the CM to hold a floor test. \"There were three main issues before the apex court: disqualification of legislators who defied the party whip, no- confidence motion against deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal and appointment of Shiv Sena legislature party leader Ajay Choudhary. I feel that in view of the clear legal position, Raj Bhavan will not ask the CM to prove his majority on the floor of the house,\" he said. The MVA's lawyer Devdutt Kamat had contended in the SC on Monday that till the pendency of the petition, Raj Bhavan should be restrained from asking the CM to prove his majority. The apex court then declined to pass an order but gave liberty to the Shiv Sena to approach it if it is aggrieved by any order.", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-political-crisis-shiv-sena-ready-to-move-sc-if-governor-orders-floor-test/articleshow/92530653.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T04:53:41+05:30"}

BrihanMumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking for Mumbai had in February issued the tender. JBM Eco Life Mobility Pvt Ltd one of the bidders challenged its May 6 ouster for being technically non-responsive. The bidders senior counsel Darius Khambata with advocate Aniesh Jadhav said the challenge is to BESTs May 6 tender summary report. Arguing before a bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice M S Karnik, Khambata submitted that BESTs conduct is in complete breach of its own tender conditions as the Tender provides disqualification only if the Bidder itself has been debarred. He said in present case the bidder was not disqualified as at the relevant time it was its group company that had received a debarment letter from Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI). Subsequently, the Delhi high court has directed that authorities should not reject the petitioners bids on the basis of the MHI letter. He also said that once petitioners financial bid was opened , BEST was bound to give the bidder an opportunity to match the Lowest Price as per the tender.
