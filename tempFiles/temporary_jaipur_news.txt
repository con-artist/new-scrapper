Drives against illegal colonies and unauthorised construction across the district will continue. We will also increase interaction with RWAs and encourage them to come forward and share information about various kinds of violations with the department to improve enforcement, he told TOI. I will also work on resolving issues between RWAs and developers in licensed colonies. This is, in fact, Madholias third stint in Gurugram . He served as an assistant town planner from 2011 to 2015 and again from 2017 to 2018. A graduate of the School of Planning and Architecture, Madholia was previously handing the issues of licenced colonies in sectors 58 to 80 as DTP at headquarters. He also worked as DTP in Yamunanagar, Karnal and Chandigarh districts. His predecessor, RS Batth, who has been transferred as DTP Karnal, conducted more than 200 demolition and sealing drives against illegal colonies in Gurugram in the past couple of years and cleared around 1,000 acres of land. Mushrooming and redevelopment of illegal colonies need to be stopped. Offenders often start developing illegal colonies after a demolition drive. Therefore, regular vigil has to be ensured by various agencies, the new DTP said. On the rising number of complaints against the property owners violating construction norms after being issued occupation certificates, he said that strict orders have been issued by top officials directing the district town planners to randomly check a few properties. In case the property owners have not adhered to the plan and made violations later, strict action would be taken against them, he said.

The dedicated childrens hospital under Delhi government is getting a new block, which was initially planned to be developed as a dedicated Covid hospital after the second wave last year. However, since there was no surge in infection, the new building was allotted for the hospitals expansion. Dr Urmila Jhamb, its director, said, We will increase the facilities over time. The expansion of departments and beds are in the pipeline. The initial focus is on a huge pediatric ICU and cardiothoracic surgery, which are the need of the hour. Most children with congenital issues find it difficult to get admission in other government hospitals. The super-specialty hospital located in Geeta Colony provides comprehensive medical care for all pediatric-related medical and surgical illnesses under one roof. Spread across 1.6 hectares, it is also being developed as a postgraduate teaching and training institute. Trauma care services and neuro surgery have also been planned. The new building with 600 beds will allow for huge expansion. Out of these, 50-60 beds will be reserved for ICU and another 50-60 for NICU. We are also upgrading radiology services and ventilators. We have procured ECO and digital X-ray machines and are working towards purchasing a CT-MRI machine. Our current bed strength is 250. We are increasing the academic seats from four pediatric MD seats to 10, apart from two MCH surgery seats, said Jhamb. The hospital sees 1,600-1,700 children daily in the OPD, 200-300 in emergency and 40-50 admissions. Currently, the hospital provides special services in pediatric, gastroenterology, neurotology, nephrology with pediatric dialysis and neurology. Psychologists are also present to take care of children and provide certificates to specially abled ones. Our OPDs mostly see cases of diarrhea, upper respiratory problems, skin issues and fever. Admissions are usually done for heart-related problems and congenital abnormalities. We have pediatric ophthalmology, a dedicated ENT, orthopedics and a reasonably large department of pediatric surgeries. Neonatal surgeries are not carried out elsewhere, so we see a good number of patients at our facility, Jhamb said. Construction is likely to get over in the next few months and the block is expected to start by the year-end. The only hindrance is shortage of medical staff. The facility currently has a vacancy of around 17 posts of faculty members, apart from junior and senior residents.", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhis-govt-children-hospital-to-expand/articleshow/92528999.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T04:52:00+05:30"}

Police received a call about the missing daughter of a labourer, and later found her body in a drain. Brijendra Kumar Yadav, DCP (Outer-North), said the girl went to sleep with her mother and sister in their shanty in Bawana on Sunday night. When her mother woke up at around 2am, she couldn't find the child. The panicked mother alerted other people and family members and their friends searched for the baby, but in vain, Yadav said. On Monday morning, around 5.30am, the family was informed by a woman rag-picker that the body of the child was lying in the drain. The family rushed to the spot, 150-200 meters away from their shack, and found their daughter dead. After the statutory formalities, the girls body was taken to the mortuary. During the inquiry, we scanned CCTV footage of the area and found that a person had sneaked into the shack and kidnapped the girl, police said on Tuesday. With the help of digital evidence, the identity of the accused was established and he was arrested. A team led by Rakesh Yadav, station house officer of Bawana police station led the investigation and questioned more than 50 people. A clue hinted at his presence in Bawana and the suspect, Sunil, a native of Etah in Uttar Pradesh, was finally nabbed. During interrogation, Sunil told us that he wanted to raise a baby and kidnapped the girl, said DCP Yadav. But Sunil had second thoughts about what he had done and fearing he might be caught, he threw the baby in the drain. His testimony is being scrutinised. We suspect that before committing the crime, he had conducted a recce of the area and the girls house. A police officer said the presence of mud and water in the cavities of the deceased baby suggested that she might have drowned to death. We are waiting for the post-mortem report, the officer said. Sunil is a semi-skilled labourer and works in a hosiery factory. He is unmarried and lives alone in a locality in Bawana.

IMD expects rain activity to begin from Wednesday and provide a respite from Thursday, even issuing an orange alert predicting light to moderate rain with gusty winds on Thursday. With the monsoon missing its normal onset date of June 27, the capital has been crying for rain. Delhi has received just 15.8mm of rainfall in June so far as against the normal of 56.1mm, a rain deficit of 72%. The monsoon is likely to hit Delhi between June 30 and July 1. It depends on rainfall distribution and rain intensity, said R K Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD. The met department hadnt forecast a date for monsoon onset in Delhi earlier to this. However, the arrival of the rain-bearing monsoon may still be delayed this year. Three to five days from the normal onset date is not considered a delayed monsoon. However, we can comment on this only after the monsoon hits Delhi, said Jenamani. According to IMD, the monsoon arrived in Delhi on July 13 in 2021 and on June 25 a year earlier. Though the met department has predicted rain activity from Wednesday, the day temperature showed no sign of abating on Tuesday. The maximum temperature recorded at Safdarjung, which is the citys base station, was 41.5 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal. Before this, the citys highest maximum temperature for the month was on June 15 with 39.6 degrees Celsius. The heat index (feel-like temperature when relative humidity is combined with temperature) was 53 degrees Celsius. The relative humidity oscillated between 74% and 45%. Due to easterly winds, the weather has become humid for the past three days, explained Jenamani. However, as the clouds have arrived, rain can be expected in the city from Wednesday. Jenamani added, On Tuesday, the maximum temperature recorded in most stations departed by four to six degrees from the normal.

As power demand in Delhi continues its northward climb, it is projected to go beyond the 8,000 MW-mark. Prior to June 9, Delhis peak power demand hadnt ever crossed 7,000 MW in the month of June. This year, the mark has already been breached nine times in June and once in May. In 2019 and 2020, the record demand was 6,314MW and 6,769 MW, respectively, both on the same date, June 29. In 2021, the peak was 6,921 MW on June 30 in 2021. The capital recorded a peak power demand of 7,166 MW on June 9, followed by 7,129 MW the following day.

While the maximum temperature at Safdarjung was recorded at 41.5 degrees C, a shade higher than the previous day's maximum of 40.9 degrees, the real feel temperature was hazardously high at around 55C. The real feel is a measure of the weather's impact on people, taking into account both temperature and humidity. While monsoon is likely to enter parts of UP and the hill states by Wednesday, it may hit Delhi-NCR on June 30 or July 1, IMD said. The wet bulb temperature (WBT) is another indicator of the impact of the weather conditions that is increasingly being used as climate change begins to hit more regions across the world. Defined as the lowest temperature at which water starts to evaporate, it can be measured by wrapping a wet cloth around a thermometer. Like real feel, WBTs also denote the combined effect of temperature and humidity on people. The WBT, as measured at Safdarjung at 2.30pm, was 30 degrees C on both Monday and Tuesday, the highest values reached so far this year. By contrast, when the highest temperature of the month was recorded on June 8, the WBT was a low 23.4 degrees C. Thats because relative humidity on June 8 (2.30pm) was 14%, which had risen more than three-fold to 45% by June 28, said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. The Met department plans to incorporate parameters such as WBT while developing a heat index for different regions of the country, which would better capture the impact of weather conditions on the population. The index could be operational by next year, sources said. Jenamani said the effect of rain in Delhi-NCR is likely to be felt by June 30 or July 1, when the maximum temperature is expected to drop to 33-35 degrees.

In January 2014, Paliwal asked the complainant, Shakuntala, to invest Rs 20 crore in his mine and assured to pay her Rs 50 lakh each month. An MoU was signed between them in February 2014. On March 3, 2014, Paliwal executed a sale deed for 1.4 hectares land in Bhilwara district in Shakuntalas favour for Rs 21 lakh. In 2017, the accused again promised good quality granite to Shakuntala and signed an MoU for Rs 20 crore.

Sources said samples collected at AIIMS, Lok Nayak Hospital and ILBS had this strain. In Haryana, the BA.2 variant remains the dominant one at present, being detected in 75% of the samples sequenced. While the Delhi government health department did not comment on the finding of the new sub-lineage, officials associated with genome sequencing stated that Central, South East and South districts had shown the presence of BA.5. South East district magistrate Isha Khosla said, Two days ago, we got instructions to intensify vaccination and follow Covid protocols strictly, so we are focusing on that. Testing, tracking and isolation is being done by the rules. So far, there are no reports of clusters emerging for B.A.5, but we are keeping track of it. We had three patients carrying the B.A.5 sub-lineage, but they have been discharged. When they were admitted, they didnt show any severity and had mild symptoms. said Lok Nayak medical director Dr Suresh Kumar. Genome sequencing is not being done on samples from any specific district or hospitals. We found two samples carrying the B.A.5 sub-lineage of Omicron, said an ILBS official. Haryana health department officials told TOI that 580 samples were sent to Rohtaks Maharshi Dayanand University for genome sequencing in May and June. Of these, 260 had been processed with 195 having the BA.2 sub-type of Omicron, 54 with BA 2.23 and BA 2.38 and BA.5 and 10 probable Omicron or XT. One was found to have the B.1.1.529 sub-variant. Gurugrams chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav said the dominance of the Omicron sub-lineages explained the current spike in cases in the region. Omicron has a higher transmissible level. Its derivatives spread rapidly in absence of hand hygiene, social distancing and masks. Dr Lalit Kant, former scientist and head, epidemiology and communicable diseases division, ICMR, said, If genome sequencing is increased, more samples will be found carrying B.A.5, which is 13-15% more infectious. Vaccine immunisation is waning and people are becoming susceptible to the virus. Dr Jugal Kishore, head, medicine department at Safdarjung Hospital, said though extra measures were not required, surveillance should continue. From June 7 to 28, Delhi recorded 47 deaths, with two days registering six deaths. Preventive measures have to be adopted and precautionary doses should be increased to protect severe cases. However, there wont be any major surge owing to the new sub-variants. Those with a compromised immune system and comorbidities may be at risk, added Kishore.", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-traces-ba-5-sub-variant-even-as-daily-covid-cases-decline/articleshow/92529395.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T04:39:00+05:30"}

Chief metropolitan magistrate Snigdha Sarvaria added that Zubairs mobile phone or laptop used by him for posting the tweet was to be recovered from his Bengaluru residence. Zubair told the court the tweet was posted in 2018 and he had used an image from a Hindi film. He said he was being targeted because he challenges powerful people. From 2018 to 2022, tweets have not created a flutter Describing the case based on an image from a Hindi movie against Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair as bordering on \"absurdity\", his counsel Vrinda Grover told a Delhi court on Tuesday that the police had called Zubair for questioning in some other case but arrested him in the present case in haste. Grover told the court that many others had tweeted the same, and the only difference between those Twitter handles and his was his faith, his name and his profession. The police had on June 27 arrested Zubair for allegedly hurting religious sentiments following a complaint by a social media user who referred to a tweet from 2018. The complainant in the case goes by the Twitter name, Hanuman Bhakt, with an image of Lord Hanuman as his profile photo. From 2018 to 2022, these tweets have not created a flutter. Not a single ingredient of the offences invoked in this case is satisfied. Which are the two groups between whom enmity is created? Who does it incite? What is the insult? Many tweeted the said tweet and still there was no flutter. Prima facie there is no case. Honeymooners and brahmacharis are not the two groups creating unrest in the country, the senior counsel told the court. Explaining her observation, she said the image in Zubairs tweet was from a 1983 film of Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Kissi Se Na Kehna, and in the scene from which the image was used in the tweet, the actress had remarked on seeing a board outside a hotel that it was not honeymoon hotel, but Hanuman hotel. The prosecution had sought extension of Zubairs custody by five days on the ground that he did not cooperate with the investigating agency and his custodial interrogation was required to gather information regarding the device from which the tweet was made by the accused. Zubair was produced before the court on the expiry of his one-day police custody. Considering that the mobile phone/laptop of the accused for posting the tweet in question is to be recovered at the instance of accused Mohammed Zubair from his Bangalore residence, that the accused has remained non-cooperative and (with) the disclosure statement on record, four days PC (police custody) remand of accused is granted since accused is to be taken to Bangalore, the judge said in the order. Responding to the argument of Grover that the film from which the image was used had not been banned and that the image had not been edited, the court said it was of no help to the accused at this stage. During the hearing, Grover said Zubair was a journalist, has a Twitter following and speaks his mind in an independent country. Zubair is being targeted for his work. He may be challenging people who are powerful but that cant be a reason for his harassment, she claimed. She said the police were asking for his laptop which has nothing to do with the case. The police are abusing their power. Zubairs laptop is a storehouse of his personal information. They want his laptop because he is a journalist. Their laptops contain sensitive information. A fishing inquiry begins when the laptop is seized. That tweet cannot withstand legal scrutiny. He has been challenging people who are speaking certain things. Will that deprive him of his liberty? she asked. Pointing out that the anonymous Twitter handle which called out Zubairs tweet was opened only in 2021, she told the judge that this anonymous social media account needed to be investigated. The entire case borders on absurdityThe penalty under 153A is a maximum of three years. The penalty under 295 is up to two years. This is a tweet from 2018. Their own cause of action is March 2018. If an anonymous Twitter handle chose to create mischief in the country, those reasons should be investigated, Grover submitted. The public prosecutor, appearing for the police, claimed that it has become a trend to outrage the religious feelings of the Hindu community to become famous. He alleged that the accused had made several such outrageous posts in the past to hurt religious sentiments. This was a deliberate effort on his (Zubairs) part to create social disharmony and hurt religious feelings. He joined the probe but did not cooperate and various material from his phone were deletedThere is a requirement of police remand. This is the first time it came to the polices knowledge, the prosecutor argued. He threatened the investigating officer. His parents have his laptop from which data will be deleted. He came with a blank phone, said the prosecutor. He added that the complainant was not anonymous and his details were known.", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/alt-news-co-founder-mohammed-zubair-in-police-custody-till-july-2/articleshow/92529383.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T04:36:00+05:30"}

The officer also pointed out, Alongside, more cases have been solved and more accused arrested compared with the figures in 2021. Times View The rising number of crimes against women in the city is a matter of concern. The police must look into the reasons and find ways to curb them. Delhi Police claimed to have taken up various initiatives aimed at womens security, including the women-staffed pink booths to assist women in need and to guide them in accessing legal remedies. All-women patrolling teams were also launched in crowded areas and outside schools and colleges to deter criminals from trying to trouble them.

However, they went for his arrest after he remained evasive and his phone was found formatted. The search memo signed by Zubair at the time of arrest showed the recovery of the notice, sources said. Police clarified that the FIR against Zubair was registered suo motu during a social media monitoring exercise. DCP (Cyber Cell) KPS Malhotra said Zubairs objectionable tweet had led to a Twitter storm with hate speeches detrimental to communal harmony. Two things, technical gadget and intention, were important. He was evasive on both and the phone had been formatted. This formed the grounds for his arrest, he added. Regarding the claim that police acted in a matter of 2018, Malhotra said time didnt matter in the investigation of a case. He added, You only have to re-tweet and it becomes new. Police action was on the basis of when the matter came to our cognisance. On the allegations of the case being politically motivated, Malhotra said if someone was booked in several cases, it was well within polices rights to question him in all. The judiciary is involved, custody was given and bail not granted. There must be some substance to the case. Calling it politically motivated doesnt stand right. The case will be investigated on merit, he added. On Monday, Zubair was arrested on the charges of promoting enmity on religious grounds and deliberately hurting religious feelings through a post on Twitter wherein he allegedly posted a questionable image with a purpose to deliberately insult the god of a particular religion. Zubair was booked under IPC sections 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc, and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony).", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/alt-news-co-founder-mohammad-zubair-case-delhi-cops-may-write-to-ed-i-t/articleshow/92529378.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T04:32:00+05:30"}

During interrogation, Kumar revealed that he had killed his wife on June 14 with the help of his brother as he was fed up with her habits, the officer said.

During questioning, he has been evasive on both fronts. We found out that his phone was formatted. His evasiveness formed the grounds for his arrest,\" KPS Malhotra, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Intelligence Fusion & Strategic Operations) said. The police officer said a four-member police team will be sent to Zubair's house in Bengaluru on Wednesday to recover evidence, including the mobile phone or laptop used by him for posting the tweet in question. The mobile phone that he is currently using is formatted and does not have information related to the case that is being investigated. However, the phone will be sent to forensic lab for examination, the officer said. During investigation, when asked about his phone through which he posted the alleged tweet in 2018, he told police that he had lost it. \"He joined the probe but did not cooperate and various material from his phone was deleted,\" he added.

The court, however, rejected the submission saying it was of no assistance to the accused at this stage. Officials in the Delhi Police told PTI that the FIR was registered on June 20 against Zubair. According to an emergency police officer on duty, \"during social media monitoring, it came to notice that a Twitter handle namely Hanuman Bhakt @balajikijaiiin shared a tweet against another Twitter handle in the name of Mohammed Zubair@zoo_bear in which it has been tweeted by Zubair that 'Before 2014: Honeymoon Hotel.

Kindly take action against this guy\". \"These words and picture found to be used by Zubair against a particular religious community and are highly provocative and more than sufficient to incite feeling of hatred amongst people which can be detrimental for maintenance of public tranquility in the society,\" the FIR stated. It further stated that transmission and publication of such posts has been deliberately done by Zubair through electronic media to insult the religious feelings of a particular community with intent to provoke breach of peace and the SI also stated that the FIR is not to be uploaded being \"sensitive\" in nature. Earlier in the day, the Delhi Police told the court that Zubair allegedly \"used controversial tweets to hurt religious feelings in an effort to get fame\". Zubair was arrested by the Delhi Police on Monday for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through one of his tweets posted in 2018, officials said. Police claimed that Zubair posted such tweets to increase his followers, but did not substantiate the claim. His arrest drew condemnations from various quarters, including journalists' bodies and Opposition parties. On Tuesday, Alt News co-founder Pratik Sinha rejected a media report that Zubair had received Rs 50 lakh in his account in the last three months. Sinha shared the news article on Twitter and said, \"Fact-check: Absolutely lies. Police is linking donations received by Alt News to Zubair. All the money that Alt News receives goes to the organisations bank and not any individuals. The bank statement of Zubair's personal account of which I have a copy debunks this falsehood.\" However, DCP Malhotra said that they are also looking at the source of funding received by Zubair and as per the investigation so far, they do have evidence that in the last three months, Zubair had received Rs 50 lakh in his bank account. When asked if Sinha has anything to do with the case, the officer said so far, his involvement has not been found.

While talking to the press in Jaipur earlier in the day, Shekhawat says that the (Union) government is ready to help the state government in making the project functional, but Gehlot is deflecting the matter with his uncalled statements. The meeting is also attended by state party brass including state president Satish Poonia, deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore and former state president Arun Chaturvedi clearly indicates that the party is seeing it as a goose with golden eggs. They passed a resolution to create awareness among the residents of these districts on how the Gehlot government is creating obstacles in the way of the project which promises prosperity of the people, said a BJP source who has attended the meeting. The project can be a game-changer for 40% of the population in the state and is seen as crucial to the assembly polls. The recent statement of Shekhawat assuring to clear the project within two months if a revised proposal is sent has sparked a fresh round of statements. The project has become a bone of contention between the state and the Centre over granting approval from Madhya Pradesh over a share of water and declaring it a national project so that share of funds changes from 60:40 to 90:10 between the Centre and the state respectively, said a source. In April, the Congress had held a day-long protest in all the 13 districts which signalled the complete politicisation of the issue by blaming the delay on the central government. The BJP doesnt want to share the credit of ERCP with the Congress at any cost. It is unlikely that it will declare it a national project under the reign of Gehlot or the Congress government. The best it can do is to facilitate the inter-state agreement between MP and Rajasthan by taking a full credit to reap the dividends in the assembly polls, said a source. The project was launched in 2017 by former chief minister Vasundhara Raje who demanded the national status in the same year from water resource minister Nitin Gadkari. The project had even become one of the key promises of the BJP in the assembly polls in 2018. It was prominently mentioned by Modi and Raje in their election speeches in Ajmer and Jaipur. Modis calling to consider it for the national project is being repeatedly highlighted by Gehlot. The former has been accusing the latter of not cooperating in the project while the latter is accusing the Modi government of betrayal by not granting the national status.", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/bjp-aims-to-reap-rich-dividends-from-eastern-raj-canal-project/articleshow/92532860.cms", "date": "2022-06-29T08:39:22+05:30"}

However, he said, We are examining the steps taken by other states in this regard, and will implement reserving government job for local if such a situation develops in the country. If it is not illegal, the state government will implement it, he said. Independent MLA Baljeet Yadav and Rajasthan Berojgar Mahasangh have been demanding reservations to local youth in government jobs. He said, the state government had already announced 3 lakh jobs to the youth in the government sector. The present government till now has given 1.25 lakh jobs, while 1 lakh jobs are under process and an announcement has been made to give 1 lakh more jobs, he said. Haryana this year notified a law reserving 75% of jobs in the private sector for local people, subject to an income ceiling of Rs 30,000 and a minimum five years of residentship in the state. Gehlot, continuing on employment for youths, said that giving equal opportunities to all is the responsibility of his government. He said that his focus will be on presenting a \"youth-centric\" budget next year while inviting suggestions from youth. \"You hold discussions, study schemes in other states, and give feedback. If you give a concrete suggestion, I will try to present a youth-centric budget next year,\" he said.

In this regard, the national health mission (state) mission director, Jitendra Kumar Soni , issued directions to all district collectors to implement the campaign in their respective districts. Screening for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) will be done in a largescale manner in the state as the virus may be transmitted from infected mother to her baby while giving birth. It can also be transmitted by contact with infected blood or other body fluids during sex, unsafe injections or exposures to sharp instruments. Chronic HCV and HBV can cause damage to liver damage, cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver cancer and even death. The Centre has also introduced National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme (NVHCP). Under Nirogi Rajasthan initiative, we will conduct screening, diagnosis and treatment of all hepatitis viruses A, B, C and E, said Dr SN Dhopuria, state nodal officer for healthy liver campaign. From jail inmates to people living with HIV will undergo screening for HBV and HCV. Since most people are unaware that they are carrying HBV or HCV, they may spread the virus to others unknowingly. Aiming to prevent the infection, the health department will now identify such cases and provide them free treatment.

The samples will be checked for Hepatitis A virus and Hepatitis E virus. It will be ensured that all sources of water should be chlorinated before water being supplied to the people for drinking purpose, a health department official said.
